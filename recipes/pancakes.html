            <h3>What are Pancakes?</h3>
            <p>Pancakes are a popular breakfast dish made from a batter consisting of eggs, milk, flour, and baking
                powder. They are
                cooked on a griddle or frying pan until golden brown, then served with toppings like syrup, butter, or
                fresh fruit.</p>
            <h3>How to Make Pancakes</h3>
            <p>Making pancakes is simple: mix dry and wet ingredients separately, then combine and cook on a hot griddle
                or pan.
                The key to fluffy pancakes is not over-mixing the batter.</p>
